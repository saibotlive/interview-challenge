Notes: I used redux (with redux dev tools) for state management which stored an array of item ids, selectors with reselect (memoisation) for getting the data needed for the Header, Side items and Menupreview.
I also used react-dnd for the first time so Items can be dragged to the preview. Items can also be added to the preview area with a mouse click.
